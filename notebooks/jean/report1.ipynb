    "# NeRF Results Report 1\n",

    "The most common cause for low quality NeRFs are the floating blobs that result from NeRF not being able to estimate the correct geometry. From one angle, the blob overlaps the 3d object in such a way that the NeRF renders the correct image and thus the loss function does not capture the geometry error during training. But from a different angle, such as an angle from the test set, the blob is seen out of position.\n",

    "In this failure case (lowest PSNR camera angle), we see that NeRF struggles to model the geometry of green portion of the top of airplane1, resulting in floating green blobs. We can see in the heatmap that other test locations that are facing this green portion also have low PSNR values. Some possible reasons for the failure to model the geometry of the green portion are:\n",
